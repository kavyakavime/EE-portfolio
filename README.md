#  Electrical & Embedded Engineering Portfolio

A collection of hands-on projects focused on **embedded systems, wireless communication, and hardware–software integration**.  
These projects explore how data moves from physical sensors through microcontrollers, across wireless links, and into software systems for analysis and visualization.

**Key Areas**
- Embedded C/C++ (Arduino, ESP32)
- UART, SPI, I2C, and parallel interfaces
- Wireless communication (ESP-NOW, Wi-Fi)
- Signal timing, latency, and packet analysis
- Hardware–software co-design
- Raspberry Pi data logging and visualization

**Project Themes**
- Sensor telemetry and data acquisition
- Distributed microcontroller systems
- Packet inspection at the embedded level
- Real-time displays (OLED/LCD)
- Reliability, latency, and loss analysis

Each project emphasizes **real-world engineering constraints** such as voltage compatibility, timing accuracy, and system observability, with documentation, schematics, and analysis included.
